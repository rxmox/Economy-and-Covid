# Python Data Processing and Visualization Application

## About the Project

This Python terminal application is designed for interactive data processing and visualization. Users can input commands to process provided CSV files containing demographic, COVID-19, and economic data, and the application outputs visualizations based on this data.

## Features

- Interactive data processing in a terminal environment.
- Customizable data plotting based on user inputs.
- Analysis and visualization of COVID-19, unemployment, and demographic statistics.

## Repository Structure

- `.gitignore` - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `Final_project.py` - The main Python script for the application.
- `LINKS.TXT` - A collection of reference links related to the project's data sources and documentation.
- `covid.csv` - COVID-19 cases and statistics data.
- `mindmap.png` - Visual representation of the project structure.
- `state_demographics.csv` - Demographic data by state.
- `state_per_capita.csv` - Income data per capita by state.
- `states_to_region.csv` - Mapping of states to their corresponding regions.
- `unemployment.csv` - Unemployment data by state.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
